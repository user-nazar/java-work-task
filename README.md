The screenshot shows the **Swagger UI** of the Library REST API available at `http://localhost:8081/swagger-ui/index.html`

- **API Title**: Library REST API  
- **Version**: 1.0.0  
- **OpenAPI Spec**: `/v3/api-docs`  
- **Base URL**: `http://localhost:8081`

From the screenshot, the `book-controller` provides:

- `GET /api/books/{id}` to fetch a book by ID  
- `PUT /api/books/{id}` to update book details by ID  
- `DELETE /api/books/{id}` to remove a book by ID

Other available endpoints include:

- List all books  
- Create new books  
- Borrow or return books

The image shows a successful response (201 Created) from the POST /api/books endpoint.
It confirms that a book titled "Harry Potter" by "Joanne Rowling" with an initial amount of 10 copies was created.
The book was assigned an ID of 1, and currently no members have borrowed it (borrowedBy: []).
